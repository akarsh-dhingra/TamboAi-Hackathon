# Collaborative AI-Powered Expense Tracker

A smart collaborative expense tracking SaaS that lets users log expenses, generate insights, and settle payments using **natural language** and a **conversational AI UI** powered by **Tambo AI**.

Instead of rigid UI flows, this app lets users *talk to the app* and instantly see interactive UI responses — charts, summaries, expense tables, and payment suggestions — all generated or modified in real time.
